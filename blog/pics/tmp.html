**Precomputed Radiance Transfer**

![Figure [PRT]: ](prt-head.png)

Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) is a method to precompute radiance transfer (complex light interaction) within a scene.
PRT also offers you a runtime technique to evaluate the amount of radiance given the emitter information and the compressed precomputed radiance transfer.

In a layman's (game developer's) term, it is a lightmap that you can also change the lighting condition!

Relighting Intuition
====================

Now, we want to relight a simple scene.
For example, that simple scene can be an envmap with bunny inside.
Instead of using complicated techniques, I first render this scene under multiple lighting conditions.

Let's say, I want to see bunny in the afternoon.
Sadly, I did not render an afternoon bunny rendered.
However, what I can do is that I can find images with the most similar lighting conditions. Then, compute a new lighting condition through linear combination of them.
In my case, I chose two images, noon and evening.
The afternoon bunny image can be computed through a simple interpolation process.

Surely, since we have only 3 different lighting conditions.
The interpolation result might look ugly.
One way to counter this problem is to prerender a lot more images with different lighting conditions.

Connection To Ambient Occlusion

Opinions
========

With the emergence of real-time raytracing, everybody are doing real-time global illumination with Path Tracing + Denoising.
However, 
- Shooting Rays is expensive.
- Unpredictable level of noise in Path Tracing. (Imagine you're rendering veach door scene)
In my opinion, for the next few years, baking and precomputing in games and fast interactive applications (>120fps) will still be preferred methods.
